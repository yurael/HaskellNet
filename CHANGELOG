0.4.4 -> 0.4.5 (2015-06-18)
---------------------------

 - IMAP: select command must quote the mailbox name
   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/35)

0.4.3 -> 0.4.4 (2015-04-11)
---------------------------

 - Fix a bug in IMAP Parser for listing Mboxes
   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/34)
 - Protocols modules re-exports AuthType
   (see https://github.com/dpwright/HaskellNet-SSL/issues/10)

0.4.2 -> 0.4.3 (2015-04-06)
---------------------------

 - Parser for IMAP LIST to return mailbox names unquoted
   (see https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/34)
 - Update to build with GHC 7.10.1

0.4.1 -> 0.4.2
--------------

 - Add sendMimeMail' to send mime mails with in-memory attachments

0.4 -> 0.4.1
------------

 - login function for IMAP must escape the password
   Due to the possibility of the password contain special characters
   (See https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/31)
 - Improved documentation for SMTP
 - Merge pull request #29 from lemol/master:
   Update on SMTP example
 - Merge pull request #26 from lemol/master:
   * Fix a bug when parsing the response of fetch in IMAP
     (See https://github.com/jtdaugherty/HaskellNet/issues/27)
   * Add a function for sending plain text email
 - Merge pull request #25 from lemol/master:
   Add a function for authentication in SMTP
 - Merge pull request #24 from lemol/master:
   Bug fix on PLAIN authentication encode

0.3 -> 0.4
----------

 - Merge pull request #22 from dpwright/parse-fix:
   Fix parser error when passing parameters to FETCH
   (See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26183675/error-when-fetching-subject-from-email-using-haskellnets-imap)
 - Merge pull request #20 from vincenthz/master:
   Replace Crypto by the much faster cryptohash
 - Merge pull request #19 from fegu/patch-1
   remove closeSMTP at end of sendMimeMail
   (sendMail and sendMimeMail should have the same behaviour towards the
   connection given to the function. In addition, Office365 causes the
   closeSMTP of sendMimeMail to raise an exception of already closed. Thus,
   removed.)
 - Merge pull request #18 from michaelbeaumont/issue17
   Stopped the POP3 module from removing whitespace before response lines
   except for the initial line with the POP3 status. Retrieved messages can now
   be correctly parsed.
 - Merge pull request #16 from fegu/master
   Fix store command to enable Office365 support (Adding a space between UID
   and flags in STORE command. This should have been there all the time, but
   while some IMAP servers (notably Gmail) accepts that it is missing, others
   (notably Office365) requires it.)
 - Merge pull request #10 from ppetr/master
   Improve `tryCommand` so that it includes the failed server response.
 - Improve a bad piece of code in `sendMail`.
   It used pattern matching and then catching the exception using `handle`,
   which is very non-idiomatic and error prone. Also the code seemed to catch
   the failure only to rethrow it.
 - Merge pull request #8 from ppetr/master
   Upgrade to mime-mail >= 0.4.
 - Merge pull request #5 from sordina/master
   Adding show constraint to show6 in Network/HaskellNet/IMAP.hs for
   compatibility with GHC 7.4.1
 - Merge pull request #4 from nh2/ghc-7.2
   Fix compilation with GHC 7.0 and 7.2 (fixes Char and List imports)

0.2.5 -> 0.3
------------

Package changes:
 * Constrained dependency on mime-mail to avoid API-breaking changes
   in 0.4
 * Removed unused dependencies on parsec, time, containers, and
   old-locale
 * Removed unused modules:
   - Data.Record
   - Text.URI
   - Text.MIME
   - Atom test module
   - Moved stream debugging module from test/ to
     Network.HaskellNet.Debug
 * Moved modules into src/

Other changes:
 * Got rid of stale module portability / maintainer / stability
   annotations in source; moved copyright annotation into Cabal file
 * Removed some stale compiler pragmas
 * Resolved compiler warnings in all modules
 * Moved to using <$> more
 * Removed a lot of stale commented-out code
 * Shortened a lot of long lines

API changes:
 * Split up IMAP module into
   Network.HaskellNet.IMAP (core functionality)
   Network.HaskellNet.Types (data types)
   Network.HaskellNet.Connection (IMAP connection functions)
 * Moved Text.IMAPParsers to Network.HaskellNet.Parsers
 * Renamed IMAP 'Mailbox' type to 'MailboxName'
 * Split up POP3 module into
   Network.HaskellNet.POP3 (core functionality)
   Network.HaskellNet.Types (data types)
   Network.HaskellNet.Connection (POP connection functions)
 * IMAP.Parsers:
   - removed unused Either handling functions
   - constraind exports (originally exported everything)commit 682edece1bf5fb5923ea5bd04309819c630ff33d
