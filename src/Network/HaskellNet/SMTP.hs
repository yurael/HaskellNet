This module provides functions for working with the SMTP protocol in the client side,
including /opening/ and /closing/ connections, /sending commands/ to the server,
/authenticate/ and /sending mails/.

Here's a basic usage example:

>
> import Network.HaskellNet.SMTP
> import Network.HaskellNet.Auth
> import qualified Data.Text.Lazy as T
>
> main = doSMTP "your.smtp.server.com" $ \conn ->
>    authSucceed <- authenticate PLAIN "username" "password" conn
>    if authSucceed
>        then sendPlainTextMail "receiver@server.com" "sender@server.com" "subject" (T.pack "Hello! This is the mail body!") conn
>        else print "Authentication failed."

Notes for the above example:

   * First the 'SMTPConnection' is opened with the 'doSMTP' function.
     The connection should also be established with functions such as 'connectSMTP',
     'connectSMTPPort' and 'doSMTPPort'.
     With the @doSMTP*@ functions the connection is opened, then executed an action
     with it and then closed automatically.
     If the connection is opened with the @connectSMTP*@ functions you may want to
     close it with the 'closeSMTP' function after using it.
     It is also possible to create a 'SMTPConnection' from an already opened connection
     stream ('BSStream') using the 'connectStream' or 'doSMTPStream' functions.

     /NOTE:/ For /SSL\/TLS/ support you may establish the connection using
             the functions (such as @connectSMTPSSL@) provided in the
             @Network.HaskellNet.SMTP.SSL@ module of the
             <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HaskellNet-SSL HaskellNet-SSL>
             package.

   * The 'authenticate' function authenticates to the server with the specified 'AuthType'.
     'PLAIN', 'LOGIN' and 'CRAM_MD5' 'AuthType's are available. It returns a 'Bool'
     indicating either the authentication succeed or not.


   * To send a mail you can use 'sendPlainTextMail' for plain text mail, or 'sendMimeMail'
     for mime mail.

I must be being stupid here

I can't seem to be able to catch the exception arising from the
connection already being closed this would be the correct way to do it
but instead we're being naughty above by just closes the connection
without first sending QUIT

This function will return 'True' if the authentication succeeds.
Here's an example of sending a mail with a server that requires
authentication:

>    if authSucceed
>        then sendPlainTextMail "receiver@server.com" "sender@server.com" "subject" (T.pack "Hello!") conn
>        else print "Authentication failed."
